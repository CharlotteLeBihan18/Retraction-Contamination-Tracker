# Retraction Contamination Tracker

A graph-backed application that maps how retracted scientific papers spread through the
citation network. Papers, citations and retractions are stored in Neo4j; a FastAPI service
exposes graph queries, and an LLM component answers questions in plain English.

The app reports **exposure and risk**, never that a paper is invalid: retraction is not
contagious, and citing a retracted paper can mean mentioning, criticising or relying on it.

> Status: in progress. Each section marked *TODO* names the team member who will write it
> (roles and task lists are in the project proposal).

## Quick start

Requirements: Docker Desktop, Python 3.11+, make, git.

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then set NEO4J_PASSWORD (8+ characters)
make install                # create .venv and install dependencies
make docker-run             # start Neo4j, the API and Nginx
```

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| API docs (Swagger, through Nginx) | http://localhost/docs |
| Health check | http://localhost/health/ready |
| Neo4j Browser | http://localhost:7474 |

Check that Neo4j and its plugins are ready:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m scripts.check_neo4j
```

## Makefile commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make help` | List all commands |
| `make install` | Create `.venv` and install runtime + dev dependencies |
| `make run` | Run the API locally with auto-reload on :8000 |
| `make docker-run` | Start the full stack in the background |
| `make docker-down` | Stop the stack (data is kept) |
| `make docker-logs` | Follow the logs |
| `make test` | Run all tests with coverage (fails below 60%) |
| `make test-unit` | Run only tests that need no running services |
| `make lint` | Run pylint (fails below 9.5) |
| `make format` | Format the code with black |
| `make clean` | Remove caches |

## Architecture

- **neo4j** (`neo4j:5.26`, official image): graph database with the GDS and APOC plugins. Ports 7474 and 7687.
- **api** (built from `Dockerfile`): FastAPI service, reachable only inside the Docker network.
- **nginx** (`nginx:1.27-alpine`): reverse proxy and the single public entry point (port 80), with rate limiting and security headers.

*TODO (Person 1): architecture diagram.*

## Tests

`make test` runs three kinds of tests:

- **Unit and API tests**: run anywhere, using a fake database.
- **Neo4j tests** (`-m neo4j`): run against a real Neo4j, skipped when it is not reachable.
- **Container tests** (`-m containers`): check the running stack through Nginx, skipped when it is down.

In GitHub Actions, the test workflow starts its own Neo4j, so the Neo4j tests always run in CI.

## Data sources

We use two sources and join them on the DOI of each paper.

- **[Retraction Watch](https://crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/retraction-watch/)** (a CSV, distributed through Crossref) tells us which papers were retracted, when, and why. We treat it as the reference for retractions. We used commit `5338abda2966b2da8b0a84e189f805867bfc5171` of the open dataset.
- **[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/)** (an API) gives us what Retraction Watch doesn't have: abstract, authors, journal, publication date and the list of works each paper cites.

We only kept one field, Dentistry, so the graph stays small enough to explore and to explain during the demo.

`python -m scripts.fetch_openalex` downloads everything into `data/cache/`. We commit that folder on purpose, so nobody needs an API key to rerun the project. `python -m scripts.ingest` then loads the cache into Neo4j. You can run it twice, you get the same graph (we use `MERGE`).

### How we matched the two sources (and what we decided)

Matching papers between two datasets is messy, so here is what we chose and why.

- **Only real retractions.** Out of 519 Dentistry rows, 16 are not retractions (corrections, expressions of concern), so we dropped them.
- **No DOI, no paper.** 46 rows had no DOI. The DOI is the only reliable key between the two sources, so we dropped them too. That leaves 457 papers.
- **Fixing broken DOIs.** Some DOIs in the CSV were URL-encoded (`%3c` instead of `<`) or written twice in a row. We repair them and store everything in lowercase, otherwise OpenAlex doesn't find the paper.
- **Matching by DOI only.** 453 of the 457 were found in OpenAlex. The 4 others are listed in `data/cache/manifest.json` and left out. We preferred losing 4 papers over guessing with fuzzy title matching and merging the wrong ones.
- **When the sources disagree, Retraction Watch wins.** For 2 papers OpenAlex doesn't flag them as retracted, but Retraction Watch does, so they stay `Retracted`.
- **One notice per source.** Each paper gets a `RetractionNotice` from Retraction Watch (with the date and the reasons) and one from OpenAlex (no date, OpenAlex doesn't give one). That way we keep track of who says what.
- **Cleaning the reasons.** Retraction Watch writes them like `+Plagiarism;+Fake Peer Review;`. We split them into separate `Reason` nodes, shared between papers, so we can count and compare them.
- **Journal names come from OpenAlex**, with the Retraction Watch name as a fallback. The citing papers also come from OpenAlex, so we get one spelling per journal.
- **Authors without an OpenAlex id are skipped** (147 links out of 2115). Without an id, two people with the same name would end up merged.
- **`before_retraction` is computed once, when loading.** We compare the full dates when we have them. If we only know the year and it is the same as the retraction year, we say "before". A citation is only called a zombie when we are sure it came after the retraction.
- **Missing abstracts.** OpenAlex has no abstract for 91 of the 453 papers (362 have one). They are loaded with an empty abstract, so any search that only reads abstracts cannot find them. Searching on title + abstract fixes that.

## Graph schema and modeling rationale

*TODO (Person 2): schema diagram, modeling decisions, rejected alternatives and the anti-genericity appendix.*

## API examples

*TODO (everyone): one example per endpoint, written by its owner (see the team table in the proposal).*

## LLM component and guardrails

*TODO (Person 3): how Ask and the audit agent work, each guardrail, and the evaluation results.*
